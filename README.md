# DesignTicTacToe
LeetCode 348 Design Tic-Tac-Toe in Java

In this problem we are required to develop two methods.

The first is a constructor which needs to initialize the variables
we will use to solve the problem. The variables are not specified.

The second method is invoked when a player makes a move.
It seems that the test scaffolding makes a call to initialize the
game and then starts making moves for the two users.
We just need to act on the moves and at some point figure out
which player wins the game.

What was interesting for me is that I have never played tic-tac-toe 
with a board with more than 3x3 spaces. In this case we can go up 
as high as 100x100 spaces.

If you are interested in my approach and comments I invite you to

Keep on reading and experimenting. It is the best way to learn.
